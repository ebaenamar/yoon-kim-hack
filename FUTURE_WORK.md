# Future Work & Next Steps

## 1. Comprehensive Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)

Our initial experiments used a fixed, modest hyperparameter configuration to establish a fair baseline. The logical next step is to conduct an exhaustive hyperparameter search to find the optimal configuration for each leading architecture.

*   **Objective:** To determine if performance gaps between architectures are fundamental or merely an artifact of the baseline configuration. Can a larger, "tuned" `RoPE` or `LSTM` close the gap with `DeltaNet` on the `MQAR` task?
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Select a representative model from each architectural family (`deltanet`, `lstm`, `rope`, `gla`).
    2.  Define a "grid" of hyperparameters to search, focusing on `d_model`, `n_layers`, and `num_heads`.
    3.  Run an exhaustive benchmark for each architecture on a challenging, fixed task (e.g., `MQAR @ kv=256`).
    4.  Compare the performance of the **best-tuned version** of each architecture to declare an "ultimate champion".
*   **Implementation Status:** The `run_benchmark.py` script has already been refactored to support this grid search functionality via command-line arguments.

## 2. Expansion of the Architecture Benchmark Suite

Our current selection of models is representative, but new and influential architectures are constantly emerging. To keep our research at the forefront, we must continuously expand our benchmark suite.

*   **Objective:** To integrate and evaluate promising new models against our established baselines.
*   **Immediate Candidates for Integration:**
    *   **`DeltaFormer`:** A more recent model from the Delta-Rule family. Comparing it to our `deltanet` implementation would provide a valuable intra-family analysis.
    *   **`Mamba-2` / `Mamba`:** A leading State-Space Model. Given the poor performance of `GLA`, testing a more powerful SSM like Mamba is critical to fairly evaluate this architectural class.
    *   **`PaTH Attention`:** An interesting model from the quadratic-complexity family that is worth investigating.
*   **Methodology:** This involves a standard model integration workflow: sourcing a reference implementation, adapting it to our benchmark's `BaseModel` interface, resolving dependencies, and validating its performance.

## 3. Debugging and Enhancing Diagnostic Tasks

Our experiments revealed areas for improvement in our task suite.

*   **Fix `hidden_mode` Task:** The `KeyError` encountered during the "Pentatl√≥n" must be debugged to include this task in our final comparative analysis. (Status: Bug identified and fixed, pending re-run).
*   **Review `Flip-Flop` Task:** The uniform poor performance of all architectures on this task suggests it may be either poorly calibrated (too hard) or that it requires a very specific set of hyperparameters. An analysis of the task's design is warranted.

By pursuing these future workstreams, we can build upon our initial findings to create a more comprehensive, robust, and insightful analysis of the sequence modeling landscape.
