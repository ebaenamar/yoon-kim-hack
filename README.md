# Architecture Pentathlon: Phase 0 - Infrastructure Validation & Protocol Refinement

## CONCLUSIONS

### EXPERIMENTAL SCOPE:
We conducted a controlled preliminary comparison of seven architectural families (DeltaNet, Gated-DeltaNet, RWKV7, GLA, LSTM, GRU, RoPE-Transformer, and Vanilla Transformer) across four diagnostic tasks under identical training constraints (d_model=256, n_layers=4, 30 epochs, lr=3e-4).

### FINDINGS:
All architectures failed to achieve meaningful learning on any task:
- **MQAR (associative recall):** best ≈ 0.72% (random ≈ 1.6%)
- **Flip-Flop (sequence memory):** all ≈ 10% (random = 50%)
- **Knapsack (algorithmic reasoning):** best ≈ 1% (random ≈ 0.1%)

The observed performance differences between architectures (e.g., DeltaNet 0.72% vs others 0.3-0.5% on MQAR) fall within the noise range and lack statistical validation.

### INTERPRETATION:
These results indicate one or more of the following:
(a) Insufficient training duration for convergence.
(b) Suboptimal hyperparameters for these task-architecture combinations.
(c) Fundamental issues with task design or implementation.

We cannot distinguish between these hypotheses without further investigation.

### LIMITATIONS PRECLUDING STRONG CONCLUSIONS:
1.  Fixed training duration (30 epochs) was insufficient for convergence assessment.
2.  No architecture-specific hyperparameter optimization was performed.
3.  Single training run per configuration prevents variance estimation.
4.  No validation that tasks are solvable under the current constraints.
5.  No statistical significance testing was applied.

### METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS:
✓ Established a unified training pipeline for diverse architectures.
✓ Identified and resolved dataset schema inconsistencies.
✓ Defined a baseline experimental protocol for future refinement.

### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
1.  **Validate Task Solvability** via extended training runs.
2.  **Conduct Systematic Hyperparameter Search** per architecture.
3.  **Implement Multi-Seed Evaluation** (n≥5) with significance testing.
4.  **Replace Fixed Epochs** with convergence-based early stopping.
5.  **Verify Metric Implementations** and task difficulty calibration.

### REVISED OBJECTIVE:
Rather than concluding architectural superiority, this phase establishes the experimental infrastructure and identifies critical protocol requirements. Valid comparative analysis awaits the implementation of the corrections outlined above.

**We recommend treating this as Phase 0 (Infrastructure Validation) rather than Phase 1 (Architectural Comparison).**
